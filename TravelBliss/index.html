We can combine your luxury Maldives holiday with an insight into true Maldivian life, whether it is tasting authentic street food or hopping aboard a local fishing boat.

Our blog is where you will find many of our experts tips and advice based on their personal experience, plus inspiring stories from the destination. You are welcome to browse and equally welcome to give us a call to start planning your own trip. The Maldives conjure up images of pristine beaches, reef-ringed atolls, and luxurious bungalows on the water where lucky guests can observe fish through glass floors and jump into the sea from their balcony. This island nation has always been on my “bucket list,” so when I decided to visit Sri Lanka and Dubai last month, the Maldives was a logical and obvious addition to my itinerary.At Experience Travel Group, we hope to help travellers unlock the true magic of the Maldives.

            <p class="center">Thailand was the first destination I decided to travel to solo. I island-hopped, explored Bangkok, and, as a young backpacker, ticked off a big bucket list item—partying until sunrise at the Full Moon Party. While that was back in 2011, it remains one of the most vibrant and beautiful places I have ever visited. Often referred to as the “land of smiles,” there is so much to offer travelers in this beautiful and bustling country. Thailand is always welcoming, despite receiving hordes of tourists all year-round. Thailand is majestic temples pull you in, and you cannot help but be drawn to the history of it all. Thailand is pristine and turquoise waters are magical, warm, and incredibly photogenic which add the perfect touch to a dream holiday.The best time to visit Thailand is in the dry season—from November to April, temperatures are cooler and you can expect picture-perfect days for outdoor activities. The only downside is that it is also Thailand is peak tourist season.While that was back in 2011, it remains one of the most vibrant and beautiful places I have ever visited.

While you will have to contend with often daily, short-lived rainstorms, you will be rewarded with cheaper flights and lower hotel rates.</p>
